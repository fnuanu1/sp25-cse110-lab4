1. The bug was that the two variables, num1 and num2 are string variables so the result data type turns out to be string which is why the two numbers are concatenated instead of being added normally like numbers.
2. I fixed it by using the parseInt() function on both num1 and num2 which basically turns both strings into integers before I added them and assigned the answer to the result variables.
